Modelling time and recursion

Timed automata are a classical formalism used to model time in finite state systems.
The classical view on timed automata uses *clocks* recording differences between the timestamps of events.
Another view is to use *registers* recording the timestamps themselves.
While these two views are essentially equivalent for finite state systems,
we argue that in the presence of recursion the register approach yields a more expressive and natural model,
and that this model is still analysable algorithmically.
